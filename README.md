# Client-Server-Command-Processing-System

Programming languages: Java

This project is a client-server application designed to showcase real-time command processing and data management. Users can input commands through a graphical user interface (GUI) on the client, which are processed by the server. Supported functionalities include adding, removing, clearing, and analyzing integer data, such as retrieving the sum, minimum, and maximum values. The application features intuitive GUIs for both the client and server, providing seamless communication and dynamic feedback on executed commands.

The system highlights the practical use of Java sockets for client-server communication while demonstrating the integration of user-friendly interfaces. It is designed as a foundational tool for learning and implementing network-based Java applications with real-time processing capabilities.
